## 1. Core Java

### Platform & Language Fundamentals

Q. How does Java achieve platform independence?  
A. Java achieves platform independence through the use of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). When you write Java code, it gets compiled into bytecode, which is platform-independent. The JVM on any platform (Windows, Linux, etc.) can interpret this bytecode and run the program, allowing it to work on any platform that has a JVM installed.

---

Q. Is Java 100% object-oriented?  
A. No, Java is not 100% object-oriented. Although Java is primarily object-oriented, it still has primitive types like `int`, `char`, `double`, etc., which are not objects. However, Java provides wrapper classes (e.g., `Integer`, `Character`) for these primitive types to make them objects when necessary.

---

Q. Can a class extend itself?  
A. No, a class cannot extend itself in Java. The class hierarchy must always be linear, meaning a class can extend another class but cannot extend itself.

---

Q. What is polymorphism? Explain with an example.  
A. Polymorphism in Java refers to the ability of one object to take on many forms. It allows one interface to be used for a general class of actions. The specific action is determined by the exact nature of the situation.

Example:
```java
class Animal {
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Animal makes a sound");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }
}

public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Animal myDog = new Dog();
        myDog.sound(); // Dog barks
    }
}
````

In this example, the `sound()` method is polymorphic; the `Dog` class overrides it to provide its specific implementation.

---

Q. What is inheritance? Explain briefly.

A. Inheritance is a mechanism in object-oriented programming where a new class acquires the properties and behaviors (methods) of an existing class. The class that inherits is called the subclass, and the class from which it inherits is the superclass.

Example:

```java
class Animal {
    void eat() {
        System.out.println("This animal eats food");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    void bark() {
        System.out.println("The dog barks");
    }
}
```

In this case, `Dog` inherits the `eat()` method from `Animal`.

---

Q. What is encapsulation and why is it important?

A. Encapsulation is the process of hiding the implementation details of a class and exposing only the necessary parts to the outside world. This is achieved by declaring class variables as `private` and providing public getter and setter methods. Encapsulation helps in data security and makes the code more maintainable.

Example:

```java
class Person {
    private String name;

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public void setName(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
}
```

Here, `name` is encapsulated inside the `Person` class, and the outside world interacts with it only via getter and setter methods.

---

### Data Structures and Algorithms

Q. What is the difference between a stack and a queue?
A. A **stack** is a data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle, meaning the last element added is the first one to be removed. A **queue**, on the other hand, follows the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle, meaning the first element added is the first one to be removed.

---

Q. What is the difference between a process and a thread?
A. A **process** is an independent unit of execution with its own memory space, while a **thread** is a lightweight unit of execution within a process. Multiple threads can exist within a single process and share the same memory space.

---

Q. Explain binary search.
A. Binary search is an efficient algorithm for finding an element in a sorted array. It works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. If the value of the search key is less than the item in the middle of the interval, the search continues in the lower half, otherwise, it continues in the upper half.

Example:

```java
int binarySearch(int arr[], int key) {
    int low = 0, high = arr.length - 1;
    while (low <= high) {
        int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
        if (arr[mid] == key) return mid;
        if (arr[mid] < key) low = mid + 1;
        else high = mid - 1;
    }
    return -1; // key not found
}
```

---

Q. What is the time complexity of common operations in a HashMap?
A. The time complexity for the common operations in a HashMap are:

* **get()**: O(1) on average, but O(n) in the worst case (when there are hash collisions).
* **put()**: O(1) on average, but O(n) in the worst case.
* **remove()**: O(1) on average, but O(n) in the worst case.

---

Q. What is the difference between a HashSet and a TreeSet?
A. A **HashSet** is an implementation of the Set interface backed by a hash table. It does not maintain any order of elements. A **TreeSet** is an implementation of the Set interface that uses a red-black tree and maintains elements in a sorted order.

---

Q. When is a linked list more efficient than an array? Provide an example.
A. A linked list is more efficient than an array when you need frequent insertions and deletions in the middle of the collection. This is because a linked list allows adding/removing elements in constant time O(1), whereas in an array, shifting elements would take linear time O(n).

---

Q. What is a graph data structure?
A. A graph is a collection of nodes (also called vertices) and edges that connect pairs of nodes. It can be directed or undirected, and is used to represent networks, such as social networks, road maps, or web links.

---

Q. How would you reverse a linked list?
A. To reverse a linked list, you can iterate through the list and change the direction of the links between nodes. Here is an example:

```java
class Node {
    int data;
    Node next;
}

Node reverse(Node head) {
    Node prev = null;
    Node current = head;
    Node next = null;
    
    while (current != null) {
        next = current.next;
        current.next = prev;
        prev = current;
        current = next;
    }
    head = prev;
    return head;
}
```

---

Q. How do hashCode and equals work in Java collections?
A. In Java collections, `hashCode()` and `equals()` are used to determine the equality of objects. The `hashCode()` method returns an integer that represents the hash code of an object, and `equals()` is used to compare objects for equality. The general rule is that if two objects are considered equal according to `equals()`, they must have the same hash code.

---

### Memory Management

Q. How does garbage collection work in Java?
A. Garbage collection in Java is the process of automatically reclaiming memory that is no longer in use by the program. It is handled by the JVM, and it automatically identifies and removes objects that are no longer referenced, freeing up memory for future use.

---

Q. What are the differences between the Young Generation and Old Generation memory spaces in Java?
A. The **Young Generation** in Java is where new objects are created. It is further divided into the **Eden space** and **Survivor spaces**. The **Old Generation** contains objects that have survived multiple garbage collection cycles. Objects are moved from the Young Generation to the Old Generation when they become older.

---

Q. Can you manually trigger garbage collection?
A. While you can call `System.gc()` to suggest that the JVM runs garbage collection, it is not guaranteed that garbage collection will actually occur. The JVM decides when to run garbage collection based on its own algorithms and memory usage.

---

Q. How can memory leaks occur in Java despite automatic garbage collection?
A. Memory leaks in Java can occur when objects are no longer needed but are still being referenced by the program. Since the garbage collector only frees memory for objects that are no longer reachable, objects that are still referenced will not be collected, leading to a memory leak.

---

Q. Difference between stack and heap memory.
A. **Stack memory** is used for method execution and local variables, and it follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. It is automatically managed. **Heap memory**, on the other hand, is used for objects that are dynamically allocated at runtime. It is managed by the garbage collector.

---

### Threading and Concurrency

Q. Creating Threads (Runnable vs Callable).
A. **Runnable** is used when you donâ€™t need to return any result from a thread. The `run()` method contains the code to be executed. **Callable** is similar to `Runnable` but allows returning a result (via `Future`), and can throw exceptions.

Example:

```java
class MyRunnable implements Runnable {
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Runnable thread");
    }
}

class MyCallable implements Callable<Integer> {
    public Integer call() {
        return 123;
    }
}
```

---

Q. wait vs notify.
A. `wait()` is used to make a thread wait until it is notified by another thread. `notify()` is used to wake up a thread that is waiting.

---

Q. How do you handle deadlocks in Java?
A. Deadlocks can be avoided by ensuring that threads acquire locks in the same order and releasing locks as soon as possible. Using timeout mechanisms or trying to acquire locks only when necessary can also help avoid deadlocks.

---

Q. What are the volatile variables and how do they work within the Java memory model?
A. A **volatile** variable in Java is one that is directly read from and written to the main memory, ensuring that changes made by one thread are immediately visible to other threads. It prevents the JVM from caching the variable value.

---

Q. Can you explain the difference between synchronized collections and concurrent collections?
A. **Synchronized collections** are traditional collections that are wrapped with synchronized blocks to ensure thread safety. **Concurrent collections** (e.g., `ConcurrentHashMap`) are designed for high concurrency and provide built-in thread safety without needing explicit synchronization.

---

Q. How does the Java memory model ensure thread safety?
A. The Java memory model ensures thread safety by providing mechanisms such as synchronized blocks, locks, volatile variables, and atomic variables to control access to shared resources and prevent race conditions.

---

Q. Thread safety (HashMap, Collections).
A. **HashMap** is not thread-safe; it can be wrapped in `Collections.synchronizedMap()` to make it thread-safe. However, it still has limitations. **ConcurrentHashMap** is thread-safe without needing to synchronize entire sections, offering better performance in multi-threaded environments.

---

### Reflection and Serialization

Q. What is reflection in Java and when would you use it?
A. **Reflection** in Java is the ability to inspect or modify the runtime behavior of a class or object. It is useful for applications like dependency injection, serialization, or testing frameworks that require dynamic inspection of objects at runtime.

---

Q. Is there any disadvantage of using reflection?
A. The main disadvantages of reflection are performance overhead, as it involves extra processing, and security concerns, as it can bypass normal access control checks.

---

Q. Do you know about serialized data?
A. **Serialization** is the process of converting an object into a byte stream so that it can be easily stored or transmitted. **Deserialization** is the reverse process, where a byte stream is converted back into an object.

---

Q. Why shouldn't we serialize data into a text file?
A. Storing serialized data in a text file is inefficient, as it involves a lot of unnecessary formatting. Binary serialization is typically more compact and efficient for storing complex objects.

---

Q. What happens if your Serializable class contains a member that is not serializable and how will you fix it?
A. If a class contains a non-serializable member, it will throw a `java.io.NotSerializableException` during serialization. To fix it, you can mark the non-serializable field with the `transient` keyword to exclude it from the serialization process.

---

### Exception Handling

Q. What is the difference between checked and unchecked exceptions?
A. **Checked exceptions** are exceptions that are checked at compile-time, such as `IOException`. They must be either caught or declared in the method signature. **Unchecked exceptions** (RuntimeExceptions) are not checked at compile-time and typically represent programming errors, such as `NullPointerException`.

---

Q. Handling exceptions in projects.
A. In projects, exceptions should be handled by using try-catch blocks. It is important to catch specific exceptions and handle them gracefully, providing meaningful messages or fallback mechanisms to ensure smooth program execution.

---

Q. try, catch, finally execution.
A. The `try` block contains code that may throw an exception. The `catch` block is used to handle exceptions. The `finally` block always executes, whether an exception is thrown or not, and is typically used for cleanup tasks.

Example:

```java
try {
    // code that may throw an exception
} catch (Exception e) {
    // handle exception
} finally {
    // cleanup code
}
```

---

Q. Multiple catch blocks.
A. You can have multiple `catch` blocks to handle different types of exceptions separately, providing more specific handling for each exception type.

Example:

```java
try {
    // some code
} catch (IOException e) {
    // handle IOException
} catch (SQLException e) {
    // handle SQLException
}
```

---

Q. Scenario where finally block doesn't execute.
A. The `finally` block will not execute if the JVM exits the program (e.g., using `System.exit()`) or if the thread executing the `finally` block is interrupted.

---

### Design Patterns

Q. Singleton design pattern.
A. The **Singleton** design pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance. It is often used for managing shared resources, like database connections.

Example:

```java
class Singleton {
    private static Singleton instance;
    
    private Singleton() {}
    
    public static Singleton getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {
            instance = new Singleton();
        }
        return instance;
    }
}
```

---

Q. How can we create Singleton classes?
A. A singleton class can be created by making the constructor private, ensuring no instances can be created outside the class, and providing a static method to get the single instance.

---

Q. Factory design pattern.
A. The **Factory** design pattern provides a way to create objects without specifying the exact class of object that will be created. It provides a method to instantiate different types of objects based on the input parameters.

Example:

```java
interface Animal {
    void speak();
}

class Dog implements Animal {
    public void speak() {
        System.out.println("Woof");
    }
}

class Cat implements Animal {
    public void speak() {
        System.out.println("Meow");
    }
}

class AnimalFactory {
    public Animal createAnimal(String type) {
        if (type.equals("Dog")) {
            return new Dog();
        } else if (type.equals("Cat")) {
            return new Cat();
        }
        return null;
    }
}
```

---

Q. Prototype design pattern.
A. The **Prototype** design pattern is used to create duplicate objects by cloning an existing object, rather than creating a new one from scratch. This is helpful when object creation is costly or time-consuming.

Example:

```java
class Prototype {
    private int x;
    
    public Prototype(int x) {
        this.x = x;
    }
    
    public Prototype clone() {
        return new Prototype(this.x);
    }
}
```

---

Q. Can you give an example of a final class and its applications?
A. A **final** class cannot be subclassed. This is useful when you want to prevent any modifications or subclassing, especially for security or performance reasons.

Example:

```java
final class MathUtil {
    public static int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }
}
```

---


## 2. Spring Framework & Spring Boot

### Spring Basics

Q. What is Spring Boot, and what are its advantages over traditional Spring applications?  
A. **Spring Boot** is a framework built on top of the Spring framework that simplifies the setup and configuration of Spring applications. It provides production-ready features such as embedded servers, metrics, and health checks. Its main advantages are:
- **Automatic configuration**: Spring Boot automatically configures your application based on the dependencies in the classpath, reducing the need for manual configuration.
- **Embedded server**: Spring Boot includes embedded servers (like Tomcat, Jetty), so you don't need to deploy a WAR file to an external server.
- **Faster development**: Spring Bootâ€™s convention-over-configuration approach allows developers to focus more on writing business logic.

---

Q. Explain dependency injection in Spring.  
A. **Dependency Injection (DI)** in Spring is a design pattern used to implement Inversion of Control (IoC). It allows objects to be injected into a class, rather than the class creating the objects itself. Spring provides DI through constructor injection, setter injection, or field injection.

Example:
```java
@Component
public class UserService {
    private final UserRepository userRepository;

    @Autowired
    public UserService(UserRepository userRepository) {
        this.userRepository = userRepository;
    }

    public void performAction() {
        userRepository.save(new User("John"));
    }
}
```
In this example, UserRepository is injected into UserService using constructor injection.

---

Q. What is the role of @SpringBootApplication?
A. `@SpringBootApplication` is a convenience annotation that combines three important annotations:

* `@Configuration`: Indicates that the class has `@Bean` definition methods.
* `@EnableAutoConfiguration`: Enables Spring Bootâ€™s auto-configuration mechanism.
* `@ComponentScan`: Tells Spring to scan for components in the same package or sub-packages.

Itâ€™s used to mark the main class of a Spring Boot application to bootstrap and launch the application.

---

Q. Spring Bean Scopes.
A. In Spring, beans can have different scopes that define the lifecycle of the bean:

* **Singleton**: Default scope. A single instance of the bean is created and shared across the application context.
* **Prototype**: A new instance of the bean is created every time it is requested.
* **Request**: A new instance is created for each HTTP request. Only available in web applications.
* **Session**: A new instance is created for each HTTP session. Only available in web applications.
* **Global Session**: Similar to `Session` but only used in a portlet-based environment.

Example of defining bean scope:

```java
@Bean
@Scope("prototype")
public MyBean myBean() {
    return new MyBean();
}
```

---

Q. @Qualifier and @Primary.
A. `@Qualifier` and `@Primary` are used to resolve ambiguity when multiple beans of the same type exist.

* **@Primary**: Marks one bean as the default to be injected when multiple beans of the same type exist.
* **@Qualifier**: Specifies which bean to inject when multiple beans of the same type exist.

Example:

```java
@Bean
@Primary
public UserService userService1() {
    return new UserServiceImpl();
}

@Bean
@Qualifier("second")
public UserService userService2() {
    return new AnotherUserServiceImpl();
}
```

To inject `userService1`:

```java
@Autowired
@Qualifier("second")
private UserService userService;
```

---

Q. Difference between @Controller and @RestController.
A. Both `@Controller` and `@RestController` are used to define controller classes in Spring MVC, but they serve different purposes:

* **@Controller**: Used for traditional MVC controllers that return a view (HTML, JSP, etc.). You need to explicitly specify the response body with `@ResponseBody`.
* **@RestController**: Combines `@Controller` and `@ResponseBody`. It is used for REST APIs and automatically serializes return objects to JSON or XML.

Example:

```java
@Controller
public class UserController {
    @RequestMapping("/user")
    public String getUser(Model model) {
        model.addAttribute("user", new User("John"));
        return "userView";  // Returns a view
    }
}

@RestController
public class UserRestController {
    @RequestMapping("/user")
    public User getUser() {
        return new User("John");  // Returns a JSON response
    }
}
```

---

### Spring Boot Auto-Configuration

Q. Explain the role of @EnableAutoConfiguration annotation in a Spring Boot application.
A. `@EnableAutoConfiguration` is a Spring Boot annotation that enables automatic configuration of Spring application components based on the dependencies present in the classpath. It automatically configures beans like data sources, JPA, web components, etc., without the need for manual configuration.

---

Q. How does Spring Boot achieve auto-configuration internally?
A. Spring Boot achieves auto-configuration by scanning the classpath for relevant libraries and applying default configuration settings for beans based on those libraries. The `@EnableAutoConfiguration` annotation triggers the process, and Spring Boot looks for `@Configuration` classes annotated with `@ConditionalOnClass`, `@ConditionalOnMissingBean`, etc., which determine whether specific auto-configuration should be applied.

Example:

```java
@Configuration
@ConditionalOnClass(DataSource.class)
public class DataSourceAutoConfiguration {
    @Bean
    public DataSource dataSource() {
        return new DataSource();  // Auto-configure a DataSource if it's available in classpath
    }
}
```

---

Q. How can you override auto-configuration in Spring Boot?
A. You can override auto-configuration in Spring Boot by:

* Providing your own custom configuration to replace the default configuration.
* Using `@EnableAutoConfiguration(exclude = { DataSourceAutoConfiguration.class })` to exclude specific auto-configurations.
* Using `@ConfigurationProperties` to customize the properties.

Example of excluding a specific auto-configuration:

```java
@SpringBootApplication(exclude = {DataSourceAutoConfiguration.class})
public class MyApplication {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(MyApplication.class, args);
    }
}
```

---

### Conditional Annotations

Q. What are conditional annotations in Spring?
A. Conditional annotations in Spring allow developers to define beans or configurations that should only be applied under specific conditions. These annotations help in enabling or disabling certain features based on the environment or classpath.

Examples of conditional annotations:

* `@ConditionalOnProperty`: Configures beans based on properties in `application.properties` or `application.yml`.
* `@ConditionalOnClass`: Configures beans if a specific class is present on the classpath.
* `@ConditionalOnMissingBean`: Configures beans only if a specific bean is not already defined.

---

Q. Have you used any conditional annotations before?
A. Yes, I have used conditional annotations like `@ConditionalOnProperty` and `@ConditionalOnClass`. They are very useful for making beans configurable based on external properties or the presence of certain libraries.

Example:

```java
@Configuration
@ConditionalOnProperty(name = "myapp.featureX.enabled", havingValue = "true")
public class FeatureXConfig {
    @Bean
    public FeatureX featureX() {
        return new FeatureX();
    }
}
```

---

Q. What are the purposes of using these conditional annotations? What do we achieve with them?
A. Conditional annotations help to create flexible and configurable Spring Boot applications. They allow you to enable or disable certain configurations or beans based on conditions like the presence of a class, property value, or profile. They make applications more adaptable to different environments or configurations without requiring code changes.

---

### Spring Profiles & Configuration

Q. Spring Boot profiles and configuration.
A. **Spring profiles** are a way to segregate parts of your application configuration and make it available only in certain environments. You can define different beans or configurations for different environments (e.g., development, production).

Example:

```java
@Configuration
@Profile("dev")
public class DevConfig {
    @Bean
    public DataSource devDataSource() {
        return new DataSource("dev-db-url");
    }
}

@Configuration
@Profile("prod")
public class ProdConfig {
    @Bean
    public DataSource prodDataSource() {
        return new DataSource("prod-db-url");
    }
}
```

You can activate a profile by setting the `spring.profiles.active` property in `application.properties`:

```properties
spring.profiles.active=dev
```

---

Q. Spring Profiles.
A. **Spring Profiles** allow you to define different sets of beans for different environments. For example, you can create a profile for testing, one for production, and one for development. Profiles can be activated either programmatically or through configuration files.

Example:

```properties
# application-dev.properties
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/dev_db

# application-prod.properties
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/prod_db
```

---

Q. Which file do you use: .yml or .properties in your current project?
A. In my current project, I use **`application.yml`** for configuration. YAML format provides better readability and a more structured way to define properties. It also allows for easy multi-level configuration.

Example of `application.yml`:

```yaml
server:
  port: 8080
spring:
  datasource:
    url: jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydb
```

---

### Dependency Injection

Q. Spring Boot dependency injection.  
A. Spring Boot uses the Spring Framework's dependency injection (DI) mechanism to manage object creation and wiring. With annotations like `@Component`, `@Service`, `@Repository`, and `@Controller`, Spring Boot automatically detects and injects beans using component scanning. DI can be done using constructor, setter, or field injection. Constructor injection is the preferred method for immutability and testability.

Example:
```java
@Service
public class MyService {
    private final MyRepository myRepository;

    @Autowired
    public MyService(MyRepository myRepository) {
        this.myRepository = myRepository;
    }
}
```

---

### Actuator and Monitoring

Q. Have you worked with or are aware of the actuator endpoints?
A. Yes, I have worked with Spring Boot Actuator. It provides production-ready features and endpoints like `/actuator/health`, `/actuator/info`, `/actuator/metrics`, which help in monitoring and managing Spring Boot applications.

---

Q. What is the dependency for this actuator?
A. To use Spring Boot Actuator, you need to add the following dependency in your `pom.xml` (for Maven):

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-actuator</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

---

Q. Can we secure these actuator endpoints?
A. Yes, actuator endpoints can be secured using Spring Security. You can configure which endpoints are exposed and who can access them using properties in `application.properties` or `application.yml`.

Example:

```properties
management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=health,info
management.endpoint.health.show-details=always
```

Security configuration:

```java
@Override
protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
    http
      .authorizeRequests()
      .requestMatchers("/actuator/**").hasRole("ADMIN")
      .and().httpBasic();
}
```

---

Q. What is the purpose of the Spring Boot Actuator?
A. The Spring Boot Actuator helps monitor and manage Spring Boot applications in production. It provides endpoints for health checks, metrics, environment info, thread dumps, and more. This helps in observing the application's runtime behavior and aids in debugging and performance monitoring.

---

Q. How would you use the Actuator in microservice architecture for monitoring?
A. In a microservices architecture, Spring Boot Actuator can expose health, metrics, and info endpoints for each service. These endpoints can be integrated with tools like **Prometheus**, **Grafana**, or **Spring Cloud Sleuth + Zipkin** to monitor and trace the behavior of each service.

For example, Prometheus can scrape `/actuator/prometheus` endpoint data for metrics aggregation and Grafana can visualize them in dashboards.

---

Q. Can you tell me about the Actuator and Micrometer?
A. Yes. **Micrometer** is the metrics collection library used by Spring Boot Actuator under the hood. It provides a facade over different monitoring systems like Prometheus, New Relic, Datadog, etc. Actuator exposes Micrometer metrics at endpoints like `/actuator/metrics` and `/actuator/prometheus`.

Micrometer lets you define custom metrics using code:

```java
@Autowired
MeterRegistry meterRegistry;

public void track() {
    meterRegistry.counter("custom.event.count").increment();
}
```

---

### AOP (Aspect-Oriented Programming)

Q. What is Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) in Spring?
A. AOP is a programming paradigm that allows you to define cross-cutting concerns (like logging, security, transactions) separately from the core business logic. In Spring, AOP allows you to intercept method calls and inject behavior before, after, or around them using aspects.

---

Q. How is AOP implemented in Spring?
A. Spring implements AOP using **proxies** (JDK dynamic proxies or CGLIB). It defines **aspects** using `@Aspect`, and you can define pointcuts and advices (e.g., `@Before`, `@After`, `@Around`) to hook into method executions.

Example:

```java
@Aspect
@Component
public class LoggingAspect {

    @Before("execution(* com.example.service.*.*(..))")
    public void logBefore(JoinPoint joinPoint) {
        System.out.println("Method called: " + joinPoint.getSignature().getName());
    }
}
```

---

Q. Can you give an advanced use case of AOP?
A. Yes, one advanced use case is **automatic auditing** in applications. You can use AOP to automatically log method execution times or track user actions (like create/update/delete).

Example: Automatically logging execution time of service methods:

```java
@Around("execution(* com.example.service.*.*(..))")
public Object measureExecutionTime(ProceedingJoinPoint joinPoint) throws Throwable {
    long start = System.currentTimeMillis();
    Object result = joinPoint.proceed();
    long duration = System.currentTimeMillis() - start;
    System.out.println(joinPoint.getSignature() + " executed in " + duration + "ms");
    return result;
}
```

---

### Spring Security

Q. How would you secure REST endpoints in Spring Boot?
A. You can secure REST endpoints using **Spring Security** by configuring HTTP security rules and enabling authentication mechanisms like basic auth, JWT, OAuth2, etc.

Example:

```java
@Override
protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
    http.csrf().disable()
        .authorizeRequests()
        .antMatchers("/api/public").permitAll()
        .anyRequest().authenticated()
        .and().httpBasic();
}
```

---

Q. What are some common security pitfalls in web applications?
A. Common security pitfalls include:

* Exposing sensitive endpoints without authentication.
* Not using HTTPS.
* Poor session management.
* Not validating input, leading to SQL injection or XSS attacks.
* Storing passwords in plain text instead of hashing.

---

Q. How does Spring Security handle authentication and authorization?
A. Spring Security handles:

* **Authentication**: Verifies user identity via credentials (username/password, token).
* **Authorization**: Grants or denies access to resources based on roles/permissions.

It provides filters (like `UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter`) and supports pluggable authentication providers (e.g., in-memory, JDBC, LDAP, JWT). You define rules in your security configuration to protect endpoints.

---

### Error Handling

Q. How do you handle exceptions in Spring Boot?
A. In Spring Boot, exceptions can be handled globally using `@ControllerAdvice` and `@ExceptionHandler`.

Example:

```java
@ControllerAdvice
public class GlobalExceptionHandler {

    @ExceptionHandler(ResourceNotFoundException.class)
    public ResponseEntity<String> handleNotFound(ResourceNotFoundException ex) {
        return new ResponseEntity<>(ex.getMessage(), HttpStatus.NOT_FOUND);
    }
}
```

You can also customize error responses using `ErrorController` or by defining `application.properties` for default error pages.

---

### Versioning & REST API

Q. Versioning in REST API.  
A. REST API versioning helps manage changes without breaking existing clients. Common methods include:
- **URI Versioning**: `/api/v1/products`
- **Header Versioning**: Custom headers like `X-API-VERSION: 1`
- **Query Parameter Versioning**: `/products?version=1`
- **Content Negotiation (Media Type Versioning)**: `Accept: application/vnd.company.app-v1+json`

Example (URI versioning):
```java
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api/v1")
public class ProductV1Controller {
    @GetMapping("/products")
    public List<Product> getAllProductsV1() {
        // return version 1 products
    }
}
````

---

Q. PUT vs POST.
A. - **POST** is used to create a **new** resource. It is **non-idempotent** (calling multiple times creates multiple resources).

* **PUT** is used to **update or create** a resource at a specific URI. It is **idempotent** (repeating the request has the same effect).

Example:

* POST: `POST /users` with body creates a new user.
* PUT: `PUT /users/101` updates or creates user with ID 101.

---

Q. Difference between PUT and PATCH.
A. - **PUT**: Replaces the entire resource.

* **PATCH**: Updates only specific fields (partial update).

Example:

```json
// PUT - sends full user data
{
  "id": 101,
  "name": "John",
  "email": "john@example.com"
}

// PATCH - only sends field to update
{
  "email": "new@example.com"
}
```

---

Q. How REST API sends data between servers.
A. REST APIs use HTTP as the transport protocol and typically exchange data using:

* **JSON** or **XML** format in the **HTTP body**.
* **Headers** to send metadata.
* **URL parameters** and **query strings** for additional data.

Servers receive requests, deserialize the JSON/XML, process it, and return a structured response.

---

### Circular Dependencies

Q. Have you heard about circular dependencies?
A. Yes, circular dependencies occur when two or more beans depend on each other, causing Spring to be unable to resolve their creation order.

Example:

```java
@Component
class A {
    @Autowired
    B b;
}

@Component
class B {
    @Autowired
    A a;
}
```

This can lead to a `BeanCurrentlyInCreationException`.

---

Q. How would you address the issue of circular dependencies?
A. Solutions include:

* **Using constructor injection carefully**: Avoid circular reference using setter or field injection.
* **Using `@Lazy` annotation**: This tells Spring to initialize the bean lazily, breaking the cycle.

```java
@Component
class A {
    @Autowired
    @Lazy
    B b;
}
```

---

Q. How would you handle circular dependencies in Spring?
A. In Spring, the best ways to handle circular dependencies are:

* Refactor code to avoid tight coupling.
* Use `@Lazy` to defer bean initialization.
* Use setter injection if constructor injection creates a cycle.
* Redesign components to follow single responsibility, reducing inter-dependencies.

---

### Component Scanning

Q. Can you explain what is component scan?
A. Component scanning is how Spring finds and registers beans automatically by scanning packages for annotations like `@Component`, `@Service`, `@Controller`, and `@Repository`.

Itâ€™s enabled by `@ComponentScan` (implicitly included in `@SpringBootApplication`):

```java
@SpringBootApplication
@ComponentScan("com.example.package")
public class MyApp { }
```

---

Q. How would you prevent a specific package from being scanned?
A. You can exclude a package using `@ComponentScan` with `excludeFilters`:

```java
@ComponentScan(
  basePackages = "com.example",
  excludeFilters = @ComponentScan.Filter(type = FilterType.REGEX, pattern = "com\\.example\\.exclude.*")
)
```

Or by using profiles or modularization.

---

### Starters & Dependencies

Q. Can you name a few common Spring Boot starters and their use cases?
A. Sure! Here are a few commonly used Spring Boot starters:

* `spring-boot-starter-web`: Web apps with REST controllers.
* `spring-boot-starter-data-jpa`: JPA with Hibernate.
* `spring-boot-starter-security`: Security and authentication.
* `spring-boot-starter-test`: Testing with JUnit, Mockito.
* `spring-boot-starter-actuator`: Monitoring and metrics.
* `spring-boot-starter-validation`: Bean validation.

---

Q. Spring Boot Starters / Starter Parent.
A. - **Spring Boot Starters** are pre-configured dependency packages to simplify setup (e.g., `spring-boot-starter-web` includes Tomcat, Jackson, etc.).

* **Starter Parent** is a special parent in `pom.xml` that provides default configurations like dependency versions and plugin setups.

```xml
<parent>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-parent</artifactId>
    <version>3.2.0</version>
</parent>
```

This reduces boilerplate and maintains consistent versions across dependencies.

---


## âœ… 3. Java 8 and Advanced Features

Q. Java 8 features.  
A. Java 8 introduced several major features:
- **Lambda Expressions**: Enables functional-style code.
- **Streams API**: For processing collections in a functional way.
- **Functional Interfaces**: Single abstract method interfaces like `Runnable`, `Comparator`, or custom ones.
- **Default and Static Methods** in interfaces.
- **Optional** class to handle null safely.
- **Method References** and **Constructor References**.
- **New Date and Time API** in `java.time`.

Example - Lambda:
```java
List<String> list = Arrays.asList("a", "b", "c");
list.forEach(item -> System.out.println(item));
````

---

Q. Can you explain about map() and flatMap()?
A. - `map()` is used to transform each element in a stream.

* `flatMap()` is used to flatten nested structures (like lists of lists).

Example:

```java
List<String> words = Arrays.asList("hello", "world");
List<Integer> lengths = words.stream()
    .map(String::length)
    .collect(Collectors.toList()); // [5, 5]

List<List<String>> nestedList = Arrays.asList(Arrays.asList("a", "b"), Arrays.asList("c"));
List<String> flatList = nestedList.stream()
    .flatMap(Collection::stream)
    .collect(Collectors.toList()); // [a, b, c]
```

---

## âœ… 4. Microservices & Cloud

### Architecture

Q. Monolithic vs Microservices.
A. - **Monolithic**: One large codebase, deployed as a single unit. Easier to start, harder to scale and maintain as it grows.

* **Microservices**: Small, independent services that communicate over HTTP or messaging. Scalable, fault-isolated, easier to develop/deploy individually, but more complex to manage.

---

Q. How would you modify an existing Spring Boot application to convert it into a serverless architecture?
A. To convert to serverless:

1. Identify independent modules that can become functions.
2. Move logic into functions compatible with AWS Lambda or Azure Functions.
3. Use Spring Cloud Function or AWS Lambda Java runtime.
4. Externalize config (use S3, Secrets Manager, etc.).
5. Replace HTTP endpoints with API Gateway.

Example using Spring Cloud Function:

```java
@Bean
public Function<String, String> uppercase() {
    return value -> value.toUpperCase();
}
```

---

Q. What is Spring Cloud and how is it useful for building microservices?
A. Spring Cloud provides tools for building microservices efficiently. It offers:

* **Service Discovery** (Eureka)
* **Config Management** (Spring Cloud Config)
* **Load Balancing** (Ribbon)
* **Circuit Breakers** (Resilience4j, Hystrix)
* **API Gateway** (Spring Cloud Gateway)
* **Distributed Tracing** (Sleuth + Zipkin)

It helps in handling cross-cutting concerns in a microservices ecosystem.

---

Q. What is the Saga pattern?
A. Saga pattern is a microservice transaction management pattern. It breaks a big transaction into smaller local transactions across services, coordinated through:

* **Choreography** (event-based)
* **Orchestration** (central controller)

Used to maintain consistency without distributed transactions.

Example: Order Service â†’ Payment Service â†’ Inventory Service â†’ Shipping Service, with compensation logic if one step fails.

---

### Integration & Communication

Q. How do you ensure zero-downtime deployment for a Spring Boot application?
A. Strategies for zero-downtime:

* **Blue-Green Deployment**: Run two environments; switch traffic once new version is ready.
* **Canary Deployment**: Gradually roll out to a subset of users.
* **Rolling Updates** with orchestration tools like Kubernetes.
* Use **load balancer** to shift traffic.
* **Health checks** with Spring Actuator.

---

Q. What is a Canary deployment?
A. Canary deployment is a technique where a new version is deployed to a small set of users first. If successful, it's rolled out to the rest. Helps reduce risk and catch issues early.

Example: Deploy v2 to 5% of traffic â†’ monitor â†’ then 100%.

---

### Monitoring

Q. How would you use the Actuator in microservice architecture for monitoring?
A. Spring Boot Actuator provides production-ready endpoints like `/actuator/health`, `/actuator/metrics`, `/actuator/info`, etc. In microservices:

* Expose metrics at `/actuator/prometheus`
* Integrate with **Prometheus** and **Grafana** for real-time dashboards.
* Use **Micrometer** for custom metrics.
* Combine with **Sleuth** and **Zipkin** for tracing.

Example: Monitor service health and request latency via Prometheus scraping Actuator metrics.

---

### Non-relational Databases

Q. Can you tell me how do you integrate a non-relational database?
A. Yes. To integrate a NoSQL DB like MongoDB:

1. Add dependency:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-data-mongodb</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

2. Define model class with `@Document` annotation:

```java
@Document
public class User {
    @Id
    private String id;
    private String name;
}
```

3. Create repository interface:

```java
public interface UserRepository extends MongoRepository<User, String> {}
```

4. Configure `application.properties`:

```properties
spring.data.mongodb.uri=mongodb://localhost:27017/mydb
```

---


## âœ… 5. Database and SQL

### SQL and NoSQL

Q. What is the difference between SQL and NoSQL databases?  
A. - **SQL** (Relational) databases use structured schemas with tables, rows, and columns. Example: MySQL, PostgreSQL.
- **NoSQL** databases are schema-less or flexible schema and store data in formats like documents, key-value, or graph. Example: MongoDB, Cassandra.

| Feature         | SQL                           | NoSQL                          |
|-----------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Schema          | Fixed schema                  | Dynamic schema                 |
| Transactions    | ACID compliant                | BASE (Eventually Consistent)   |
| Scalability     | Vertical                      | Horizontal                     |
| Examples        | MySQL, PostgreSQL             | MongoDB, Cassandra             |

---

### Schema Design

Q. You mentioned delivery partner â€” can you design the schema for delivery partner?  
A. Yes. Here's a basic schema for a **Delivery Partner**:

```sql
CREATE TABLE delivery_partner (
    partner_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    phone_number VARCHAR(15),
    vehicle_type VARCHAR(50),
    is_available BOOLEAN,
    rating FLOAT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
````

---

Q. Can you now design the schema for food delivery partner?
A. A **Food Delivery Partner** schema could include relationships with orders and location tracking:

```sql
CREATE TABLE food_delivery_partner (
    partner_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    phone_number VARCHAR(15),
    current_location VARCHAR(255),
    is_on_delivery BOOLEAN,
    assigned_order_id INT,
    rating FLOAT,
    FOREIGN KEY (assigned_order_id) REFERENCES orders(order_id)
);
```

This allows us to track which partner is delivering which order, and their current status/location.

---

### Joins and Queries

Q. What are joins in SQL? Name their types.
A. Joins are used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column.

Types of joins:

* **INNER JOIN**: Returns matching rows.
* **LEFT JOIN**: All rows from the left table, matched rows from the right.
* **RIGHT JOIN**: All rows from the right table, matched rows from the left.
* **FULL OUTER JOIN**: All rows when there's a match in either table.
* **CROSS JOIN**: Cartesian product of both tables.

---

Q. Queries for highest/second highest salary.
A.

**Highest salary**:

```sql
SELECT MAX(salary) FROM employee;
```

**Second highest salary** (Method 1 - subquery):

```sql
SELECT MAX(salary) 
FROM employee 
WHERE salary < (SELECT MAX(salary) FROM employee);
```

**Second highest salary** (Method 2 - LIMIT/OFFSET):

```sql
SELECT salary 
FROM employee 
ORDER BY salary DESC 
LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1;
```

---

### Database Operations

Q. What is data normalization?
A. Data normalization is the process of organizing data to reduce redundancy and improve integrity. It involves dividing large tables into smaller related tables.

Forms:

* **1NF**: Atomic values.
* **2NF**: No partial dependencies.
* **3NF**: No transitive dependencies.

Example:
Instead of storing customer address repeatedly, we keep it in a separate table and use a foreign key.

---

Q. What is the difference between DELETE, TRUNCATE, and DROP?
A.

| Command  | Deletes Data | Can be Rolled Back | Removes Structure |
| -------- | ------------ | ------------------ | ----------------- |
| DELETE   | Yes          | Yes (if in txn)    | No                |
| TRUNCATE | Yes (all)    | No                 | No                |
| DROP     | Yes (all)    | No                 | Yes               |

* `DELETE`: Deletes rows conditionally.
* `TRUNCATE`: Deletes all rows, faster, no rollback.
* `DROP`: Deletes entire table schema.

---

Q. How would you integrate a relational database (e.g., MySQL) with a Spring Boot application?
A.

Steps:

1. Add dependency:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>mysql</groupId>
  <artifactId>mysql-connector-java</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

2. Add configuration in `application.properties`:

```properties
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydb
spring.datasource.username=root
spring.datasource.password=secret
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
```

3. Define Entity:

```java
@Entity
public class User {
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue
    private Long id;
    private String name;
}
```

4. Create Repository:

```java
public interface UserRepository extends JpaRepository<User, Long> {}
```

---

Q. Database schema migration without downtime.
A.

To achieve zero-downtime migration:

* Use tools like **Flyway** or **Liquibase**.
* Apply **non-breaking changes first**: Add columns, add nullable fields.
* **Deploy new version** supporting old + new schema.
* **Backfill or migrate data** if needed.
* Remove old columns/constraints later in another release.
* Monitor using health checks and logs.

Best Practice:

```bash
1. Add new column (nullable)
2. Deploy new app version writing to both old + new
3. Backfill data
4. Remove old column
```

---


## âœ… 6. DevOps, Server & Tools

Q. Have you used CI/CD pipelines? If so, explain the process.  
A. Yes, I have worked with CI/CD pipelines using **GitHub Actions** and **Jenkins**. CI/CD automates testing, building, and deploying code.

Typical CI/CD flow:
1. **Commit Code** to Git.
2. **CI (Continuous Integration)**:
   - Code is built and tested automatically.
   - Tools: Maven/Gradle, JUnit, SonarQube for quality check.
3. **CD (Continuous Deployment/Delivery)**:
   - Build is deployed to a staging or production server.
   - Tools: Docker, Kubernetes, Helm, AWS CodeDeploy, or Jenkins.

Example GitHub Actions YAML:
```yaml
name: CI Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Set up JDK
        uses: actions/setup-java@v3
        with:
          java-version: '17'
      - name: Build with Maven
        run: mvn clean install
````

---

Q. Can we create a server in a Java application without using the Spring Framework?
A. Yes, we can create a basic HTTP server in Java using the built-in `com.sun.net.httpserver.HttpServer`.

Example:

```java
import com.sun.net.httpserver.HttpServer;
import com.sun.net.httpserver.HttpHandler;
import com.sun.net.httpserver.HttpExchange;
import java.io.*;

public class SimpleServer {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
        HttpServer server = HttpServer.create(new InetSocketAddress(8080), 0);
        server.createContext("/hello", new MyHandler());
        server.setExecutor(null);
        server.start();
    }

    static class MyHandler implements HttpHandler {
        public void handle(HttpExchange exchange) throws IOException {
            String response = "Hello, World!";
            exchange.sendResponseHeaders(200, response.length());
            OutputStream os = exchange.getResponseBody();
            os.write(response.getBytes());
            os.close();
        }
    }
}
```

This creates a lightweight HTTP server without any framework.

---

### ðŸ†• Extra Helpful Questions

Q. How do you containerize a Spring Boot application using Docker?
A.

1. Create a `Dockerfile`:

```dockerfile
FROM openjdk:17
COPY target/myapp.jar app.jar
ENTRYPOINT ["java", "-jar", "app.jar"]
```

2. Build and run:

```bash
docker build -t myapp .
docker run -p 8080:8080 myapp
```

---

Q. What is the use of SonarQube in a CI pipeline?
A. **SonarQube** is used for **code quality analysis**. It checks for:

* Code smells
* Bugs
* Security vulnerabilities
* Code coverage (with Jacoco)

You can integrate it in CI to break builds on quality gate failure.

---

Q. What is your experience with Git branching strategies?
A. Iâ€™ve worked with:

* **Feature branching**: Each feature in a separate branch.
* **Git Flow**: Uses branches like `develop`, `release`, `hotfix`, and `main`.
* **Trunk-based development**: Small, frequent commits to `main`.

Example Git commands:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/login
git commit -m "Add login logic"
git push origin feature/login
```

---

Q. How do you monitor applications running on the server?
A. I use:

* **Spring Boot Actuator** for app health
* **Prometheus + Grafana** for metrics
* **ELK Stack** (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) or **Graylog** for log monitoring
* **Alerts** through Slack/Email on performance issues

---


## âœ… 7. Software Engineering & Testing

Q. What testing strategies would you recommend for Spring Boot applications?  
A. I recommend a **layered testing approach**:

1. **Unit Testing**: Using JUnit + Mockito for service, controller logic.
2. **Integration Testing**: Using @SpringBootTest to test app behavior across layers.
3. **End-to-End (E2E)** Testing: Using tools like Selenium/Postman/Newman.
4. **Contract Testing**: For microservices using Pact.
5. **Test Coverage**: Tools like Jacoco or SonarQube to ensure >80% code coverage.

Example:
```java
@RunWith(SpringRunner.class)
@SpringBootTest
public class UserServiceTest {
    @Autowired
    private UserService userService;

    @Test
    public void testFindUserById() {
        User user = userService.findById(1L);
        assertNotNull(user);
    }
}
```

---

Q. How do you ensure the quality and maintainability of your code?
A. I ensure quality through:

* Writing unit & integration tests.
* Following SOLID principles and design patterns.
* Code reviews with team.
* Using SonarQube for static code analysis.
* Keeping code DRY (Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself) and modular.
* Refactoring legacy or duplicate code.

---

Q. Can you describe a challenging situation you faced in a project?
A. Once, we had a production issue where an API randomly failed due to **thread starvation** caused by blocking DB calls. I used profiling tools and discovered connection pool exhaustion. I fixed it by:

* Optimizing DB queries.
* Increasing the connection pool.
* Switching to **asynchronous methods** using `@Async` for non-blocking logic.

This improved response time and reduced errors.

---

Q. How does the Agile methodology impact your project workflow?
A. Agile makes development **iterative and adaptive**. Here's how it helped:

* We deliver features in **sprints (2 weeks)**.
* **Daily stand-ups** improve communication.
* **Sprint reviews/demos** ensure business alignment.
* Bugs and improvements are planned in **backlogs**.
* Tools like **Jira** help manage stories and track progress.

Got it! Hereâ€™s the improved **SDLC** section, as per your request, in the exact format you provided:

---


## âœ… 8. Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)


Q. What is SDLC and what models have you worked with?
A. **SDLC** is the process of planning, developing, testing, deploying, and maintaining software. Iâ€™ve worked mostly in:

* **Agile**: Iterative, fast feedback cycles.

* **Waterfall** (earlier in academic projects): Linear.

* **Scrum-based SDLC**: Sprints, story grooming, estimation with story points, retrospectives.

Phases:

1. Requirement Gathering

2. Design

3. Development

4. Testing

5. Deployment

6. Maintenance

---

Q. How do you manage changes in requirements during a project in Agile?
A. In **Agile**, changes are a part of the process. We handle changes in the following ways:

* **Product Backlog**: New requirements or changes are added as **backlog items**.

* **Sprint Planning**: During sprint planning, we prioritize and plan new or changed requirements into the current or future sprints.

* **Daily Stand-ups**: Any issues arising from changes are discussed and resolved in daily stand-ups.

* **Retrospectives**: At the end of each sprint, we reflect on what went well and what could be improved, including handling changes.

---

Q. How do you ensure that SDLC phases are properly followed in your project?
A. I ensure that the SDLC phases are followed by:

* **Creating a clear project plan**: Defining objectives, deliverables, and timelines for each phase.

* **Frequent communication**: Regular check-ins with the team and stakeholders to ensure alignment.

* **Tracking progress using project management tools**: Tools like Jira, Trello, or Asana help in tracking tasks and ensuring we follow the SDLC phases.

* **Quality checks**: Ensuring that code reviews, tests, and deployment are done per the defined processes.

---

Q. Can you explain how SDLC is different in a traditional waterfall model vs Agile?
A. In **Waterfall**:

* Phases are completed in a strict linear sequence. For example, design is done only after the requirements are fully gathered.
* Changes to requirements can be very expensive and difficult to implement once a phase is completed.

In **Agile**:

* Work is broken down into small, manageable increments called **sprints**.
* Requirements can evolve during the project, and changes can be made more flexibly.
* It promotes collaboration, feedback, and iteration, ensuring continuous improvement.

---

Q. How do you handle deadlines in Agile development?
A. In **Agile**, we manage deadlines through:

* **Sprint Planning**: Breaking work into smaller tasks and assigning deadlines within each sprint.
* **Time-boxing**: Every sprint is time-boxed, and we ensure that work completed aligns with the sprint goal.
* **Constant feedback**: Daily stand-ups to track progress and address any potential delays.

---

Q. What is the importance of documentation in SDLC, especially in Agile?
A. Documentation in **Agile** should be minimal yet effective:

* **User Stories**: Documenting features as user stories allows for clear understanding and prioritization.
* **Sprint Backlogs**: Keeping a record of the tasks, estimates, and work progress for each sprint.
* **Retrospective Notes**: Documenting what went well and what needs improvement for future sprints.

While **Agile** emphasizes working software over extensive documentation, essential documentation is still necessary to keep the team aligned and track progress.

## âœ… 9. System Design

Q. How would you design a URL shortener like Bitly?
A. **Basic Components**:

* UI/Frontend
* Backend API (to generate and resolve short URLs)
* Database (to store mappings)

**Design Approach**:

1. **Generate a unique short key** (base62 or hash).
2. **Store `short_url` â†’ `long_url` mapping** in a relational database.
3. **Use Redis for caching**: Popular URLs are cached for fast retrieval.
4. **Use a Load Balancer** for traffic distribution to multiple instances.

**Tech Stack**:

* Spring Boot
* MySQL/Redis
* Nginx for reverse proxy

**Challenges & Considerations**:

* **Collisions**: What if the generated short key already exists? You can either regenerate or use a sequential counter.
* **Scalability**: Horizontal scaling of backend APIs to handle a large number of requests efficiently.

---

Q. How would you design a scalable notification system?
A. **Basic Components**:

* Message Queue (Kafka or RabbitMQ)
* Worker Services (for processing and sending notifications)
* Retry and Dead-letter Queue for failed jobs
* Database to store the notification history

3. **Retry Mechanism**: If a notification fails, it is retried a few times before being placed in the dead-letter queue.
4. **Database**: Store all notifications, including sent status, retry attempts, etc.

**Scalability**:

* Horizontal scaling of worker nodes to handle large volumes of notifications.
* Async processing ensures non-blocking and efficient performance.
* Use of **Quartz** for recurring notifications.

**Tech Stack**:

* Kafka/RabbitMQ for messaging
* Spring Boot for backend
* PostgreSQL/MySQL for data storage
* Redis for caching

**Real-life Example**:
In a large e-commerce application, an order confirmation email might need to be sent to thousands of users. Using a message queue allows the system to handle this massive load by distributing the notification tasks among multiple worker services.
