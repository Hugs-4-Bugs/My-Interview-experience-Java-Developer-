## âœ… 1. Core Java

### Platform & Language Fundamentals

**Q: How does Java achieve platform independence?**
Java uses the concept of the **Java Virtual Machine (JVM)**. Java code is compiled into **bytecode**, which can be run on any platform that has a JVM. This makes Java platform-independent.

**Q: Is Java 100% object-oriented?**
No, Java is not 100% object-oriented because it uses **primitive data types** (int, float, etc.), which are not objects.

**Q: Can a class extend itself?**
No, a class **cannot extend itself**. This would lead to infinite inheritance and is logically incorrect.

**Q: What is polymorphism? Explain with an example.**
Polymorphism allows methods to behave differently based on the object invoking them.

```java
class Animal {
    void sound() { System.out.println("Animal sound"); }
}
class Dog extends Animal {
    void sound() { System.out.println("Bark"); }
}
Animal a = new Dog();
a.sound(); // Output: Bark
```

**Q: What is inheritance? Explain briefly.**
Inheritance is when a class (child) derives properties from another class (parent). It promotes code reusability.

**Q: What is encapsulation and why is it important?**
Encapsulation is binding data and methods into a single unit (class) and restricting access using access modifiers. It increases security and maintainability.

### Data Structures and Algorithms

**Q: What is the difference between a stack and a queue?**

* **Stack**: LIFO (Last In First Out)
* **Queue**:
